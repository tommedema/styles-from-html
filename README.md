# styles-from-html
Given html, will return all css styles from style tags as a concatenated string, as well as the resulting html with these style tags removed. Useful when you need to pass in css that is separated from html to another library while having declared css rules within embedded html documents (e.g. for request performance optimization).

## Installation

```bash
npm install --styles-from-html
# or yarn add styles-from-html
```

## Why not use cheer.io?

While it is generally [frowned upon](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/45974) to use regular expressions for parsing HTML, this library makes a conscious choice to do so anyway, but only for the sole purpose of passing style tags. This results in significant performance improvements. A suite of tests is used to ensure the stability of the implementation. If you feel like there is any reason to use cheer.io or alternative HTML parsers anyway, please create a real world test case that does not resolve with the built-in regular expression.
